# Readme

## Welcome to my wiki

To access my wiki you just open the file named *intro.md*.

### **What this wiki contains**

This wiki contains a few of the important tools that I feel are important to have in every project. The tools being the code editor I use, my browser of choice, which JavaScript runtime and what source control management I use. I also bring up how to generate an SSH key and use it as authentication on Github.

I bring up 15 Git commands that I feel are useful if you are new to Git and want to learn the basics. I have written 10 Git commands for local use and 5 for remote use. To understand Git even better, I have also made an illustration showing how the 10 local Git commands work together.

Lastly I have a written a small FAQ section that answers what Github is, why you need Github and common issues when collaborating using Git
